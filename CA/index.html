<h3>question 3</h3>
<p>
    URL is a web address that identify resource on the internet, it consist of protocol, domain name, and path. example https://www.itcarlow.ie , in this scenario http is the protocol, www is the web server or hostname, itcarlow is the domain, ie is the top-level domain.
</p>
<p>
    DNS translates human readabl domain name  of IP addresses, whish allows browser to locate web server by name and numerical IP addresses
</p>
<p>
    TLD is the last segment of domain name. there's TLD depending on country(.ie), TLD for organization (.org), for education(.edu), etc(.int, .html)
</p>
<p>
    cookies are small pieces of data sent by the web browser to client browser, used for user authentication, session management, tracking user behaviour, etc. it remembers your site preference, and use it to show relevant stuff to you
</p>
<p>
    web browsers rendering engines can cause difference in the display, because browser develop independently of each other, multiple rendering engines drive page layout, DOM support varies, browser uses independent javascript engine
</p>
<p>coahing involves storing copies of frequently accessed web resources on client or proxy. coahing reduces the load of web servers and improve page load time by serving cached content when possible</p>
